          <h2>Finding the job listing</h2>
          <p class="funParagraph", id="testP">I currently work part time at the University of Pennsylvania, performing entry level customer service. Working at Penn gives me access to the Penn jobs board, where departments throughout the university can post job listings for internal hires. <break/>After starting LaunchCode, I started taking peeks at jobs for programmers around the university (pro-tip: there are a lot) but I found that I wasn't yet qualified to fill them. However, I found one position that stood out to me. It was for an Administrative Coordinator for Wharton Computing. It's administrative, not technical, but it is in an office full of programmers, data analysts, engineers, etc. and I would be working directly with these people. I met all of their requirements and then some, so I applied.</p>

          <h2>Applying for the job</h2>
          <p id="secondP">Before applying, I had to brush up my resume. I hadn't fomrally applied for a job since September of 2019 so I had some serious edits to make. I also had to modify the way I recounted my previous experience in order to make it as appealing as possible and relevant to this possition.<break/>I was also required to submit a cover letter. This was the first time I've ever written a cover letter, so I spent a significant amount of time on google reading exapmples of cover letters and studying best practice. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed writing my cover letter as it gave me an opportunity to express a little bit more personality. Once my resume was updated and my cover letter was written, and both were proof-read a few dozen times, I submitted my application.

          <h2>Preparing for the interview</h2>
          <p id="thirdP">After submitting my application, I waited. I tried not to let it take up too much space in my brain. However, when I was checking my email in the waiting room at the doctor's office, I saw, "Administrative Coordinator-- Hello Joseph, I saw your application for the administrative coordinator position and your resume stood out. I'd love to talk to you about this position and learn mroe about what makes you a good fit." YES! I was so excited they weren't able to take my blood pressure until the end of my check-up. Now I had to prepare.<break/>I startred simple, by making sure that my suit was clean. Then, I went back to google to look up what sort of questons I can expect for an interview for this kind of position. I also googled the location of the interview and made a plan for how I was going to get there. I also spent some time brushing up on my excel skills. Lastly, I reached out to our very own Keighan Gunther for advice on what I can do to feel more prepared. He gave me some wonderful insight into every single step of the process. I did all of this while working five days a week and keeping up with my classwork, but this was definitely the part where I let it take up a lot of space in my brain.</p>

          <h2>The interview process</h2>
          <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8d3650_198d78e22db543cb8e2bfc981921bb16~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_820,h_461,al_c,q_90/8d3650_198d78e22db543cb8e2bfc981921bb16~mv2.jpg" alt="trees shaking hands">
          <p id="fourthP">There have been two steps to the interview process. The first was a telephone interview with the hiring manager. First, she explained the position and the department in more detail. Then she asked me a few of the standard questions; "Tell me about yourself," "Tell me about a conflict you had and how you resolved it," "Are you able to lift 50 pounds," kind of stuff. I had the opportunity to ask some questions as well. I asked about how the department responded to the coronavirus pandemic, and I asked about the history of the position.<break/>Two days after the phone interview, I got an email inviting me to the next step in the process. A formal interview! The formal interview was a little nerve wracking. It was this past Monday, so of course it was a billion degrees outside so I was very concertned that I'd show up to the interview soaking wet. Plus, I would be meeting the whole team where as before I was just talking to the hiring manager. But I think I did a pretty good job! I won't know for sure until next week but I'm feeling pretty confident! It's still taking up a lot of my brain energy, so I'm using this assignment to help process and cope with the <strong>stress.</strong></p>
